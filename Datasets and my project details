COVID-19 Data Analysis in U.S. Prisons

Overview
We analyzed COVID-19 infection trends in U.S. prisons using data visualization tools.

My Contribution: Hypothesis 1
I focused on Hypothesis 1 - Overcrowded prisons show a higher COVID-19 infection rate.

What I Did:
- Cleaned raw data using Excel
- Created charts using Tableau to show the trends
- Found that overcrowded prisons had 20% more infections
- Explained this in a video (watch below)
