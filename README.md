Visualizing COVID-19 Spread in Overcrowded U.S. Prisons – Hypothesis 1 Focus

🧾 Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of COVID-19 infection trends in U.S. prisons, with a focus on visualizing overcrowding effects on infection rates. Using Excel for data preparation and Power BI/Tableau for visualization, we explored various hypotheses and presented data-backed insights for decision-making.

This README outlines the project's objectives, business problems, analytical approach, individual contributions, visual results, and final takeaways.

🎯 Objectives
Examine the relationship between prison overcrowding and COVID-19 infection rates
Create interactive dashboards to visualize trends across regions and facilities
Identify high-risk facilities based on capacity utilization and case count
Provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders and decision-makers

🧩 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from public government datasets and nonprofit aggregators tracking COVID-19 cases in correctional facilities. The data included:

- [📊 COVID-19 Prison Case Counts](https://github.com/harikrishna3704/covid19-prison-analysis/blob/main/covid_prison_cases.xlsx)
- [📈 COVID-19 Prison Infection Rates](https://github.com/harikrishna3704/covid19-prison-analysis/blob/main/covid_prison_rates.xlsx)

These files contain prison-level data on inmate and staff infection rates, capacities, and trends over time.

💼 Business Problems and Analytical Approach
We framed and addressed multiple hypotheses to solve the core problem:
"What factors contribute most to COVID-19 vulnerability in prisons?"

📌 Hypothesis 1 (My Contribution):
"Overcrowded prisons have a significantly higher COVID-19 infection rate compared to those operating at or below capacity."

👨‍💻 My Role
I was responsible for:
Cleaning and transforming the raw dataset using Excel
Creating visual dashboards in Power BI to explore Hypothesis 1
Comparing infection rates between overcrowded and compliant prisons
Presenting key takeaways via a narrated video demo (see below)

🛠 Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
Power BI (Dashboard & Data Visualization)
Tableau (Exploratory visuals used by team)
Video editing tools for final project presentation

📊 Key Findings & Conclusion
Facilities operating above capacity had a 20% higher infection rate than those below or at capacity.
The visual dashboard helped identify geographic clusters of high-risk prisons.
These insights support calls for decarceration or better infrastructure in vulnerable areas.
Data visualization played a key role in transforming raw figures into public health action points
