Project Overview Response
ðŸ”¹ What is this project about?
This project focused on analyzing the spread of COVID-19 in U.S. prison systems using real-world datasets. 
We visualized infection rates across facilities to uncover trends, identify high-risk areas, and assist in data-driven public health decisions.

ðŸ”¹ What problem does it solve?
U.S. prisons experienced disproportionately high COVID-19 infection rates, especially in overcrowded facilities. 
This project aimed to uncover data-backed evidence of those trends and present them through intuitive dashboards 
to support policymakers in identifying facilities that required urgent intervention.

ðŸ”¹ What was your role?
I led the analysis for Hypothesis 1: Overcrowded prisons have significantly higher COVID-19 infection rates compared to those operating within capacity. 
I cleaned the relevant data, built interactive Power BI visualizations, and presented actionable insights. 
My visual analysis clearly highlighted a 20% higher infection rate in overcrowded facilities, validating the hypothesis.
